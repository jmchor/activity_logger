 <h1 align="center">Taskmeister - The lifesaver for your productivity needs</h1>

 <div align="center">
   Taskmeister is an app to help you plan recurring activities for every week or just a single task.

   With a calendar view on the weeks tasks, organize what you want to do. Build habits using this app - and learn a thing or two!

   This app was deployed using MongoDB Atlas for database handling as well as [cyclic.sh](https://cyclic.sh/) for the Node processes.

## Project Description

### Basic Functionalities

- Create a user with password and email authentication, security question and answer
- Create a task with a title, a description - chose between a recurrence (on one or multiple weekdays for the remainder of the year) or a task that only happens once
- mark a task as done/undone
- View the weeks schedule which displays all of the current weeks tasks
- View the weeks after or before the current week
- See today's tasks on the home screen
- View a task in detail
- Edit one task or all recurrences of this task
- Delete one or all recurrences of this task

### Advanced Functionalities

- Procrastinate: postpone any given task by a day!
- Learn something new with the Random Fact API on the home screen!
- Forgot your password? Answer a security question and create a new one?
- Want a new password? Update it from the profile!
- Want to stay logged in? Don't forget to "Remember me"!
- Don't want to use the app anymore? Go ahead and delete your profile!

### Backlog

- Advanced UI design (header / footer)

  - JavaScript charting library
- crypto
- hbs
- authentication middleware function (to discern logged-in/out states)

Base structure organization using [Ironlauncher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ironlauncher) generator by Ironhack.

The [Random Fact API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/facts) is used to improve the user experience even further.

## Installation

After cloning the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmchor/activity_logger.git
```

### Trivia

In order to cut loading times for the **Random Fact API** call down to a minimum, we followed a "get many, show one" approach: the API call fetches *as many facts as possible*, while **only one** gets shown on page load. When there are no more facts - new ones will be fetched.
