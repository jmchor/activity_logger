# TaskTastrophe - Don't let your tasks become a desaster

## Project Description

TaskTastrophe is an app to help you plan recurring activities for every week or just a single task.

With a calendar view on the weeks tasks, organize what you want to do. Build habits using this app - and learn a thing or two!

### Basic Functionalities

- Create a user with password and email authentication, security question and answer
- Create a task with a title, a description - chose between a recurrence (on one or multiple weekdays for the remainder of the year) or a task that only happens once
- mark a task as done
- View the weeks schedule which displays all of the current weeks tasks
- View the weeks after or before the current week
- See today's tasks on the home screen
- View a task in detail
- Edit one task or all recurrences of this task
- Delete one or all recurrences of this task

### Advanced Functionalities

- Procrastinate: postpone any given task by a day!
- Learn something new with the Random Fact API on the home screen!
- Forgot your password? Answer a security question and create a new one?
- Want to stay logged in? Don't forget to "Remember me"!
- Don't want to use the app anymore? Go ahead and delete your profile!

### Backlog

- Statistics page for User Profile
